# DahuaFaceRecognition
Facial recognition using VB.NET for Dahua NVR

This is a VB.NET application that uses the NVR from Dahua. The actual face recognition is a function of the NVR itself. This app hooks on to the events that are triggered from the NVR when a face is detected.

This code is about 70% done as it gets multiple live streams from the NVR and is triggered when a face is detected. The code to recognise the face is as per the documentation, but doesn't work. No idea why not.

You'd need an NVR from https://www.dahuasecurity.com/mena/products/All-Products/Network-Recorders/WizSense-Series to work with the code.
